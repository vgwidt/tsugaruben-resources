# tsugaruben-resources
A collection of resources related to the Tsugaru-dialect.

I have tons of resources scattered all over the place.  My goal is to try to consolidate links (URLs, DOIs, ISBNs, etc) to those resources here.

** Warning ** Links may change.  I'll do my best to add Wayback Machine links if archived.
